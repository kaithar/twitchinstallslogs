[1446352611] <p0larity> I'm starting to get an ocular migraine so I guess that's my cue to actually go to sleep. Not being able to see things puts a damper on enjoying a good train-wreck, anyhow.
[1446352648] <nichdel> My favorite personal alias is yogurt, which checks the arch news feed is w3m and then runs yaourt -Syyua
[1446352658] <slycedix> See ya around P0larity
[1446352663] <nichdel> bye bye P0larity
[1446352674] <thekmap> @P0larity auras?
[1446352678] <p0larity> Yeah...
[1446352685] <p0larity> I'll check the news tomorrow. :)
[1446352686] <thekmap> @P0larity induce vomiting and gtfo
[1446352741] <nichdel> Also a tiling manager might be prudent as well
[1446352748] <nichdel> if we get that far
[1446352775] <f00barbob> scrotwm
[1446352786] <slycedix> We should just use X and only X
[1446352797] <f00barbob> i think the name changed, but... scrotwm
[1446352801] <nichdel> nah man, run something in wayland
[1446352829] <f00barbob> just run stuff out of an xterm or something...

[1446353021] <nichdel> Thekmap I believe I have doxxed you
[1446353026] <nichdel> Are you the hacker 4chan?
[1446353031] <thekmap> @Nichdel cool can you bring me limes
[1446353067] <nichdel> step 1) pretend you *hate* limes
[1446353072] <nichdel> step 2) purposely get doxxed
[1446353074] <f00barbob> would you accept lemons? or are you partial to limes...
[1446353093] <thekmap> @F00barbob needs to be limes

[1446353319] <aterfax> "Cool off"
[1446353324] <deelowe1> should be starting soon
[1446353325] <slycedix> http://i.imgur.com/f7rJAZ7.gif Actually
[1446353332] <slycedix> This is 4chan
[1446353378] <aterfax> tha gif is excellent for more than the obvious
[1446353382] <nichdel> can confirm, I met him on the darknet once
[1446353387] <deelowe1> https://twitter.com/twitchshell
[1446353391] <aterfax> the *** store person is following him around
[1446353437] <slycedix> I love that gif so much
[1446353505] <mindluxthepony> i made that it looks so good
[1446353524] <thekmap> @Slycedix damn you caught me
[1446353530] <twitchintheshell> Still here guys, when the stream returns it will be a test stream followed by the launch again
[1446353539] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell still waitin on my mod
[1446353547] <mindluxthepony> awsome
[1446353551] <nyaonikusu> so i assume it will be here only?
[1446353654] <slycedix> We all are KMAP
[1446353656] <slycedix> We all are
[1446353661] <nyaonikusu> did you think of having it get its internet through a seperate computer
[1446353665] <el_durn> BabyRage never mod BabyRage
[1446353674] <nyaonikusu> then having that computer run through a tor network
[1446353683] <nichdel> Relevant: started pandora nad first song is Swordfish by Dead Milkman
[1446353689] <thekmap> @Nyaonikusu yes, do that. its 100% secure, no way to bypass that Kappa
[1446353692] <nichdel> thus I believe Kmap is indeed 4chan
[1446353697] <nyaonikusu> didnt say it was 100%
[1446353699] <aterfax> honestly
[1446353702] <slycedix> You are joking right Nyaonikusu
[1446353704] <aterfax> thats just shifting the problem
[1446353710] <aterfax> instead of shitting in your own yard
[1446353717] <aterfax> you shat in next doors
[1446353722] <aterfax> kinda douchey
[1446353723] <thekmap> @Aterfax you need to change back to orange man, i miss you was orange
[1446353725] <f00barbob> removing the need for internet connectivity to the instance is probably the most effective way of preventing.... happenings

[1446353944] <thekmap> make sure youre using an out of date flash player :)
[1446353953] <slycedix> Always
[1446353962] <gangwolf1337> Linux flash: v11
[1446353969] <aterfax> gone are the days of empornium
[1446353975] <aterfax> that place was *** hilarious
[1446353982] <aterfax> they had 4k before youtube had 1080p
[1446354001] <nichdel> a lot of places had 1080 and 4k before youtube
[1446354016] <slycedix> Youtube was way late to the party
[1446354022] <nichdel> until they grew to any size whatsoever and found out why youtube didn't have 1080 yet
[1446354023] <aterfax> that is true
[1446354076] <renakunisaki> too bad Youtube is balls
[1446354101] <slycedix> ^
[1446354110] <aterfax> where 1080p means 720p
[1446354125] <aterfax> eat *** bitrate google says
[1446354128] <slycedix> and where 480p means 4 pixels
[1446354147] <thekmap> yo when did /r/gonewildcurvy become /r/fatchicks
[1446354155] <renakunisaki> when it was created
[1446354156] <nichdel> preach
[1446354162] <aterfax> last 2 or 3 years
[1446354167] <goochguy> day 1
[1446354179] <renakunisaki> and it doesn't matter what resolution because the video will just get deleted for some BS reason anyway
[1446354182] <aterfax> Feminists for ya
[1446354187] <aterfax> Don't body shame
[1446354188] <renakunisaki> or just plain won't work
[1446354189] <goochguy> anything over 80lb is a fat chick
[1446354196] <aterfax> so now any fat *** sow is "sexy"
[1446354206] <renakunisaki> we are talking about chickens right? FrankerZ
[1446354223] <goochguy> equally bangable
[1446354228] <slycedix> "You are not allowed to tell me I am unhealthy because I think i look atractive"
[1446354242] <aterfax> it is an interesting dichotomy
[1446354248] <aterfax> because what they're actually saying is
[1446354265] <aterfax> my opinion is ok and right, but you can't have an opinion and yours is wrong
[1446354283] <aterfax> I love seeing that doublethink
[1446354287] <goochguy> just get the harpoons boys we'll be okay.
