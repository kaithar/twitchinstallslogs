[1446352611] <p0larity> I'm starting to get an ocular migraine so I guess that's my cue to actually go to sleep. Not being able to see things puts a damper on enjoying a good train-wreck, anyhow.
[1446352648] <nichdel> My favorite personal alias is yogurt, which checks the arch news feed is w3m and then runs yaourt -Syyua
[1446352658] <slycedix> See ya around P0larity
[1446352663] <nichdel> bye bye P0larity
[1446352674] <thekmap> @P0larity auras?
[1446352678] <p0larity> Yeah...
[1446352685] <p0larity> I'll check the news tomorrow. :)
[1446352686] <thekmap> @P0larity induce vomiting and gtfo
[1446352741] <nichdel> Also a tiling manager might be prudent as well
[1446352748] <nichdel> if we get that far
[1446352775] <f00barbob> scrotwm
[1446352786] <slycedix> We should just use X and only X
[1446352797] <f00barbob> i think the name changed, but... scrotwm
[1446352801] <nichdel> nah man, run something in wayland
[1446352829] <f00barbob> just run stuff out of an xterm or something...
[1446352831] <slycedix> HA "run" "wayland"
[1446352848] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell when is the stream starting
[1446352868] <slycedix> Should be around 1 EST
[1446353021] <f00barbob> 0100?
[1446353021] <nichdel> Thekmap I believe I have doxxed you
[1446353026] <nichdel> Are you the hacker 4chan?
[1446353031] <thekmap> @Nichdel cool can you bring me limes
[1446353067] <nichdel> step 1) pretend you *hate* limes
[1446353072] <nichdel> step 2) purposely get doxxed
[1446353074] <f00barbob> would you accept lemons? or are you partial to limes...
[1446353093] <thekmap> @F00barbob needs to be limes
[1446353098] <f00barbob> k

[1446353198] <aterfax> The hacker known as 4CHAN
[1446353213] <slycedix> Who is this 4chan
[1446353237] <thekmap> not me Kappa
[1446353248] <frisha> I think he a hacker
[1446353251] <frisha> *he's
[1446353257] <aterfax> Slycedix I did have a confirmed image
[1446353260] <aterfax> allow me to find it
[1446353282] <aterfax> http://i.imgur.com/qjtBRrk.gif
[1446353292] <thekmap> i'm invincible!
[1446353316] <aterfax> Didn't 007 say
[1446353319] <aterfax> "Cool off"
[1446353324] <deelowe1> should be starting soon
[1446353325] <slycedix> http://i.imgur.com/f7rJAZ7.gif Actually
[1446353332] <slycedix> This is 4chan
[1446353378] <aterfax> tha gif is excellent for more than the obvious
[1446353382] <nichdel> can confirm, I met him on the darknet once
[1446353387] <deelowe1> https://twitter.com/twitchshell
[1446353391] <aterfax> the *** store person is following him around
[1446353437] <slycedix> I love that gif so much
[1446353505] <mindluxthepony> i made that it looks so good
[1446353524] <thekmap> @Slycedix damn you caught me
[1446353530] <twitchintheshell> Still here guys, when the stream returns it will be a test stream followed by the launch again
[1446353539] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell still waitin on my mod
[1446353547] <mindluxthepony> awsome
[1446353551] <nyaonikusu> so i assume it will be here only?
[1446353654] <slycedix> We all are KMAP
[1446353656] <slycedix> We all are
[1446353661] <nyaonikusu> did you think of having it get its internet through a seperate computer
[1446353665] <el_durn> BabyRage never mod BabyRage
[1446353674] <nyaonikusu> then having that computer run through a tor network
[1446353683] <nichdel> Relevant: started pandora nad first song is Swordfish by Dead Milkman
[1446353689] <thekmap> @Nyaonikusu yes, do that. its 100% secure, no way to bypass that Kappa
[1446353692] <nichdel> thus I believe Kmap is indeed 4chan
[1446353697] <nyaonikusu> didnt say it was 100%
[1446353699] <aterfax> honestly
[1446353702] <slycedix> You are joking right Nyaonikusu
[1446353704] <aterfax> thats just shifting the problem
[1446353710] <aterfax> instead of shitting in your own yard
[1446353717] <aterfax> you shat in next doors
[1446353722] <aterfax> kinda douchey
[1446353723] <thekmap> @Aterfax you need to change back to orange man, i miss you was orange
[1446353725] <f00barbob> removing the need for internet connectivity to the instance is probably the most effective way of preventing.... happenings
[1446353739] <slycedix> He is orange for me KMAP
[1446353745] <slycedix> Refresh
[1446353749] <aterfax> better?
[1446353749] <nichdel> kinda peach orange for me
[1446353752] <thekmap> @Aterfax ty
[1446353753] <aterfax> nope that did not work
[1446353757] <aterfax> ok maybe it did
[1446353760] <thekmap> its orange now for me
[1446353770] <nichdel> there you go

[1446353810] <thekmap> @Aterfax so funny lol, i got people sending me resumes and ***
[1446353822] <slycedix> We don't need that link every 3 minutes
[1446353832] <thekmap> @Aterfax got the mofo's address on it and everything
[1446353835] <aterfax> Do they not realise, you haven't even proved yer affiliation yet>
[1446353836] <deelowe1> should be testing soon
[1446353837] <gangwolf1337> ok @Slycedix
[1446353845] <aterfax> I mean, people are literally doxing themselves
[1446353855] <gangwolf1337> but just in case, let me know
[1446353864] <thekmap> so, anyone want a job? i'm hiring :)
[1446353874] <slycedix> If someone asks what happened, link the post
[1446353875] <aterfax> Especially because you get a bonus
[1446353881] <nichdel> Can you pay me to be snarky?
[1446353883] <gangwolf1337> @Thekmap can i send u a link?
[1446353886] <slycedix> otherwise it is just us here and we already know
[1446353893] <aterfax> Is that link TBLOP?
[1446353894] <thekmap> @Gangwolf1337 you are my favorite t roll
[1446353914] <gangwolf1337> Keepo
[1446353919] <thekmap> who needs tblop when you can just go to eporner and get 1080p 60fps porn
[1446353938] <slycedix> Or /r/4kpornvids
[1446353944] <thekmap> make sure youre using an out of date flash player :)
[1446353953] <slycedix> Always
[1446353962] <gangwolf1337> Linux flash: v11
[1446353969] <aterfax> gone are the days of empornium
[1446353975] <aterfax> that place was *** hilarious
[1446353982] <aterfax> they had 4k before youtube had 1080p
[1446354001] <nichdel> a lot of places had 1080 and 4k before youtube
[1446354016] <slycedix> Youtube was way late to the party
[1446354022] <nichdel> until they grew to any size whatsoever and found out why youtube didn't have 1080 yet
[1446354023] <aterfax> that is true
[1446354076] <renakunisaki> too bad Youtube is balls
[1446354101] <slycedix> ^
[1446354110] <aterfax> where 1080p means 720p
[1446354125] <aterfax> eat *** bitrate google says
[1446354128] <slycedix> and where 480p means 4 pixels
[1446354147] <thekmap> yo when did /r/gonewildcurvy become /r/fatchicks
[1446354155] <renakunisaki> when it was created
[1446354156] <nichdel> preach
[1446354162] <aterfax> last 2 or 3 years
[1446354167] <goochguy> day 1
[1446354179] <renakunisaki> and it doesn't matter what resolution because the video will just get deleted for some BS reason anyway
[1446354182] <aterfax> Feminists for ya
[1446354187] <aterfax> Don't body shame
[1446354188] <renakunisaki> or just plain won't work
[1446354189] <goochguy> anything over 80lb is a fat chick
[1446354196] <aterfax> so now any fat *** sow is "sexy"
[1446354206] <renakunisaki> we are talking about chickens right? FrankerZ
[1446354223] <goochguy> equally bangable
[1446354228] <slycedix> "You are not allowed to tell me I am unhealthy because I think i look atractive"
[1446354242] <aterfax> it is an interesting dichotomy
[1446354248] <aterfax> because what they're actually saying is
[1446354265] <aterfax> my opinion is ok and right, but you can't have an opinion and yours is wrong
[1446354283] <aterfax> I love seeing that doublethink
[1446354287] <goochguy> just get the harpoons boys we'll be okay.
[1446354309] <aterfax> >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhVRissCjDo
[1446354320] <aterfax> WHITE WHALE HOLY GRAIL
[1446354331] <gangwolf1337> Oh no @Aterfax https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951
[1446354349] <slycedix> God damnit gang
[1446354360] <aterfax> Gangwolf1337 is there something new in there?
[1446354378] <gangwolf1337> @Slycedix I can't help it, and @Aterfax yup
[1446354378] <nichdel> I don't see anything new in the hn feed Gangwolf1337
[1446354386] <levitanious> Nyawh~
[1446354399] <gangwolf1337> @Nichdel then add somthing
[1446354433] <gangwolf1337> @Nichdel need a link? KevinTurtle
[1446354438] <nichdel> wut
[1446354455] <aterfax> http://i.imgur.com/QDLag15.jpg
[1446354501] <levitanious> Oh, btw, what editor people agreed on using? :D
[1446354509] <slycedix> I expected that to be one of those nice guys finish last comics
[1446354510] <levitanious> Was it vi for lulz sake?
[1446354511] <slycedix> I was wrong
[1446354521] <nichdel> 1 true vi
[1446354529] <alteplex> probably nano?
[1446354533] <gangwolf1337> vim
[1446354535] <levitanious> Nano +1 tho
[1446354536] <aterfax> vim because *** more characters up in this ***
[1446354547] <slycedix> vim
[1446354553] <nichdel> Sadly I don't think vim is installed by default so for sanity probs nano
[1446354555] <gangwolf1337> emacs, Kappa
[1446354556] <levitanious> q.q i'm in minority it sims.
[1446354561] <levitanious> seams! (sowwy)
[1446354562] <renakunisaki> rip irc
[1446354566] <aterfax> Guys for the low of *** god
[1446354566] <thekmap> my favorite editor is netcat -e /bin/bash kmap.com 1337
[1446354569] <alteplex> vi is installed by default
[1446354571] <aterfax> use the AUI
[1446354574] <aterfax> scripts
[1446354576] <nichdel> vi /= vim tho
[1446354577] <slycedix> Vim and Nano are both on arch iirc
[1446354580] <alteplex> I knoe
[1446354586] <aterfax> https://github.com/helmuthdu/aui
[1446354588] <aterfax> ^
[1446354593] <aterfax> Save everyone the *** effort
[1446354599] <levitanious> Lol?
[1446354601] <nichdel> let's just use cat and echo instead of editors
[1446354610] <aterfax> Nichdel too easy
[1446354616] <aterfax> I expect sed and awk only
[1446354624] <levitanious> touch it, cat it, vi it, shred it.
[1446354667] <levitanious> Who needs that everything.
[1446354673] <aterfax> Thekmap how many times should I overwrite a pen drive before it's "erased"
[1446354675] <levitanious> Let's just /dev/random everything.
[1446354681] <aterfax> I'm slapping it 7 times
[1446354682] <levitanious> We'll be stuck for months xD
[1446354687] <alteplex> Pen drives are flash memory
[1446354688] <renakunisaki> just one time, with 10000 volts.
[1446354688] <aterfax> but I'm tempted to just drill it
[1446354692] <alteplex> only once
[1446354704] <aterfax> Alteplex correct in theory
[1446354706] <thekmap> @Aterfax destroy it
[1446354711] <aterfax> That doesnt apply to SSDs though
[1446354712] <levitanious> Destroy it.
[1446354719] <aterfax> Cast it into the FIRES
[1446354720] <nichdel> alias a command to pull one char's length of input from /dev/random
[1446354722] <aterfax> DESTROY IT
[1446354723] <levitanious> SSD's has the "safe erase" in firmware but
[1446354727] <nichdel> feed it randomly into ***
[1446354728] <levitanious> It's... i dunno.
[1446354734] <aterfax> Levitanious its not safe
[1446354738] <levitanious> ikr
[1446354741] <kylerb888> What's up with the new channel?
[1446354742] <aterfax> the way SSDs have block breakage
[1446354752] <aterfax> you can get entire preserved blocks Read only
[1446354756] <aterfax> cannot erase
[1446354759] <f00barbob> 1400C recommended for complete data removal
[1446354765] <alteplex> Even with HDD's only one wipe is really needed.
[1446354768] <aterfax> F00barbob not for HDDs
[1446354773] <aterfax> curie point is like
[1446354776] <aterfax> 500?
[1446354776] <f00barbob> indeed, oven tempeature :3
[1446354778] <f00barbob> ye
[1446354784] <nichdel> Aterfax just fill it with porn repeatedly
[1446354808] <goochguy> or 0's. 0's are cool too.
[1446354817] <renakunisaki> 500C is 932F, whose oven goes that high
[1446354821] <alteplex> dd /dev/zero
[1446354830] <aterfax> Nichdel what do you think I am trying to get rid of Kreygasm
[1446354848] <goochguy> CP
[1446354855] <aterfax> god no
[1446354857] <slycedix> Rena, I hear the Ovens in WWII got pretty hot
[1446354858] <goochguy> lmao
[1446354858] <f00barbob> my oven, prob'ly
[1446354872] <renakunisaki> well sure but not many of us have access to those
[1446354887] <aterfax> I cannot have anyone find my administrative nurses quadruple stump porn.
[1446354895] <alteplex> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX iflag=nocache oflag=direct bs=4096
[1446354921] <levitanious> time for some perl -e action i see? :D
[1446354941] <jadedsarrow> wont 4k block sizes be kinda slow with those flags?
[1446354952] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell hurry up man
[1446354956] <f00barbob> just do bs=65536 and let the rest be sorted out byt the system
[1446355020] <levitanious> Oh, meanwhile. What's gonna be ontop of X?
[1446355021] <nichdel> bs=2
[1446355022] <levitanious> a WM?
[1446355023] <levitanious> DE?
[1446355034] <alteplex> i3
[1446355040] <alteplex> have to go tiling
[1446355044] <nichdel> i3 is a good choice
[1446355047] <thekmap> were gonna install vmware, and then install a windows box on top of that, and im going to backdoor the windows box
[1446355057] <levitanious> o_o
[1446355063] <nichdel> I'd pref bspwm if we want the challenge of writing the configs first
[1446355064] <levitanious> exploitabl
[1446355070] <levitanious> fluxbox here~
[1446355077] <levitanious> Dunno how many of you do prefer it.
[1446355077] <thekmap> and then im going to escape the windows box, root the arch, then escape qemu and wite the host machine
[1446355089] <goochguy> 10/10
[1446355099] <levitanious> Not deep enough
[1446355105] <thekmap> then i will change the streamer's cell phone background to dickbutt
[1446355111] <levitanious> Ah.
[1446355112] <goochguy> "twitch watches thekmap hack things"
[1446355115] <aterfax> 10/10 would reverse tunnel again
[1446355147] <levitanious> Amazingly fast the replacement was found tho.
[1446355148] <nichdel> hacker horror story: root the windows machine to find it's in a vm, root the vm to find it's on bsd, root bsd to end up back in the windows machine
[1446355149] <jkentfromgithub> via adb?
[1446355150] <nichdel> forever
[1446355171] <aterfax> >twitch installs arch and finds were actually in a pocket universe
[1446355177] <levitanious> Windows machine on vps
[1446355183] <levitanious> *
[1446355186] <airwolf84> twitch uninstalls twitch
[1446355188] <twitchintheshell> Test stream incoming
[1446355192] <levitanious> Yay!
[1446355194] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell mod me!
[1446355197] <goochguy> yay
[1446355198] <alteplex> We should put some kind of cryptocurrency miner on it
[1446355201] <slycedix> Me too
[1446355207] <nichdel> Twitchintheshell mod me!
[1446355209] <renakunisaki> it's Amigas all the way down.
[1446355210] <twitchintheshell> Alteplex I support this idea.
[1446355229] <nichdel> instead of installing everything can we just get x up and ssh -x into a working machine?
[1446355243] <goochguy> hows that fun
[1446355250] <thekmap> @Nichdel yes make the box internet-accessible Kappa
[1446355255] <defying> yay Keepo
[1446355268] <levitanious> Wonders of the web~
[1446355270] <thekmap> can someone tell me when the stream is actually up, i have flash disabled
[1446355281] <justin97530> What happened to twitchinstalls?
[1446355285] <levitanious> It died.
[1446355287] <goochguy> nobody tell him, it'll be funny.
[1446355287] <jadedsarrow> nobody tell him when it's up

[1446355310] <aterfax> of 5 hours ago
[1446355315] <nichdel> ^
[1446355317] <nichdel> baaaad memories
[1446355322] <alteplex> those were dark times
[1446355327] <justin97530> do the organisers know who did it?
[1446355330] <airwolf84> bad RAM?
[1446355333] <alteplex> full of kappa passwords
[1446355333] <levitanious> When Aranna was young, but not innocent?
[1446355338] <goochguy> bad memories of repeating "no there was a botnet" every 5 seconds when someone new joins lol
[1446355348] <nichdel> we're pretty sure it was Thekmap aka 4chan aka modhim2015
[1446355350] <y7r4m> Hows it going?
[1446355371] <goochguy> i agree all signs point to thekmap
[1446355377] <thekmap> :(
[1446355382] <levitanious> The ScapeGoat.
[1446355384] <alteplex> I got it, we should download a car, and copy that floppy!
[1446355387] <levitanious> Change your nick.
[1446355407] <nichdel> Twitch Gets a Cease and Desist for Pirating on a Public Stream
[1446355415] <levitanious> xD

[1446356079] <alma_ata> nah haskell would be too hard
[1446356084] <alma_ata> Twitch writes Perl code, on the other hand...
[1446356101] <renakunisaki> Perl could actually work, it's just random keyboard mashing anyway Kappa
[1446356107] <levitanious> lol, Linus has quite a colorful reaction on things
[1446356115] <f00barbob> sigils everywhere
[1446356123] <mg80> Twitch sounds too much like twat
[1446356126] <alteplex> just need to manage to put ftp://ftp.gtlib.gatech.edu/pub/gentoo/releases/amd64/autobuilds/20151029/stage3-amd64-20151029.tar.bz2 in
[1446356129] <f00barbob> twatch?
[1446356131] <nichdel> twitch signs up for and launches a webservice
[1446356143] <levitanious> B-but..
[1446356149] <alma_ata> twitch launches a startup
[1446356151] <renakunisaki> twatch is what I named a script to run Livestreamer Kappa
[1446356151] <levitanious> Stream hoes was banned?
[1446356151] <alma_ata> twitchr.io
[1446356157] <alteplex> stream our own stream.
[1446356166] <alteplex> crossing the streams
[1446356173] <renakunisaki> it's t watch obviously Kappa
[1446356174] <levitanious> Right now chat makes this channel
[1446356180] <levitanious> twatch~
[1446356180] <nichdel> I hope they keep this running indefinitely
[1446356191] <mg80> my new friends....
[1446356195] <alma_ata> it would be funny how far we can take it lol
[1446356198] <airwolf84> twitch saves 15% on car insurance by switching to Geico
[1446356199] <nichdel> so eventually it's just a working arch install that people use for running emulators and stuff
[1446356219] <levitanious> What do you use arch for tho?
[1446356221] <alteplex> No, its a gentoo install
[1446356226] <irisiridal> you're never done installing arch
[1446356228] <levitanious> Gentoo is a tool.
[1446356230] <levitanious> Boo gentoo.
[1446356237] <lrvick> your mom is a tool
[1446356240] <lrvick> funtoo++
[1446356243] <goochguy> the final solution is to install a gameboy emulator and do "Twitch installs arch linux to play pokemon"
[1446356245] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell with the next-level strats of waiting until no one cares anymore before launching the stream
[1446356247] <nichdel> twitch successfull maintains a working arch install
[1446356262] <alma_ata> twitch activates arch testing repos
[1446356267] <nichdel> oh god
[1446356273] <nichdel> who would even
[1446356280] <f00barbob> twitch compiles KDE from source?
[1446356284] <levitanious> Ugh.
[1446356287] <mg80> I'm only here because I thought it would be entertaining when reading about it
[1446356288] <alteplex> some people just want to watch the world burn.
[1446356288] <levitanious> No. Not that, please.
[1446356291] <mg80> And it's entertaining
[1446356294] <levitanious> The world compile.
[1446356299] <f00barbob> ah, emerge world
[1446356302] <f00barbob> the fun
[1446356303] <levitanious> Some people (hellow Lrvick)
[1446356313] <f00barbob> on a pentium III 500 laptop
[1446356313] <levitanious> just love to watch the world compile.
[1446356318] <alma_ata> the universe started when someone typed in
[1446356320] <alma_ata> emerge universe
[1446356321] <mg80> ASL?
[1446356321] <f00barbob> (spoilers: it crashed after about 2 days)
[1446356328] <levitanious> xD
[1446356332] <alma_ata> but that guy set the entropy parameter wrong
[1446356334] <alteplex> American Sign Language?
[1446356341] <mg80> all day
[1446356343] <nichdel> Twitch Doesn't Install Anything
[1446356346] <renakunisaki> Arithmetic Shift Left obviously
[1446356355] <kaithar> One time, when I was much younger, I did tried to do a stage 1 gentoo on a 486 with like 256MB of memory
[1446356364] <levitanious> Artificial Snack Loop
[1446356368] <alteplex> Twitch does suicide linux.
[1446356382] <goochguy> there are multiple stages of gentoo?
[1446356384] <kaithar> one particular compile, glibc probably, ran for something like a week and then exhausted the memory
[1446356386] <mg80> Async Switch Loop?
[1446356387] <alma_ata> yeah there is
[1446356388] <goochguy> what is gentoo's final form?
[1446356394] <f00barbob> indeed, based on how much pre-made crap you want i guess
[1446356397] <thekmap> holy crap man can we get started or what
[1446356401] <levitanious> Gentoo's final form is
[1446356402] <alteplex> Fool, this isn
[1446356403] <levitanious> MegaGentoo
[1446356404] <alteplex> 't
[1446356406] <slowthisbirddown> twitch builds a distro
[1446356408] <alteplex> its final form
[1446356409] <airwolf84> Genthree
[1446356412] <thekmap> the botnet i rented is expiring soon Kappa
[1446356414] <levitanious> It evolves at level 70
[1446356417] <goochguy> LOL
[1446356418] <levitanious> lo
[1446356420] <levitanious> lol
[1446356425] <kaithar> gentoo stage 1 is basically "compile everything at least twice"
[1446356426] <thekmap> but seriously lets go man hurry up
[1446356429] <levitanious> I told you it was rented.
[1446356429] <renakunisaki> Twitch creates Digimon
[1446356447] <slowthisbirddown> twitch makes half life 3
[1446356451] <goochguy> twitch plays league of legends
[1446356453] <levitanious> @Kaithar not twice, it's thrice, you forgot the configs.
[1446356453] <alteplex> Twitch buys weed
[1446356457] <alteplex> on the darknet
[1446356459] <slowthisbirddown> lmao ^
[1446356463] <airwolf84> Twitch crunches for SETI uses BOINC
[1446356464] <mg80> But you can save 15% on car insurance. So youre good
[1446356465] <jkentfromgithub> Twitch writes synthesizable Verilog. ... might actually be more boring than this
[1446356469] <levitanious> LOL
[1446356470] <levitanious> +1
[1446356476] <thekmap> Twitch uses Tails Linux
[1446356477] <kaithar> stage 3, which is the only official way these days, has at least some stuff compiled right heh
[1446356486] <levitanious> Twitch reverses verilog programs on VAX
[1446356496] <f00barbob> my most recent attempt to gentoo failed miserably, while the compiler received an accurate description of the CPU's capability flags, the VM it was running in appeared to be incapable of dealing with the,... invalid opcode type nonsense ensued, so i wrote it off
[1446356517] <f00barbob> AVX, specifically. dunno why
[1446356531] <alma_ata> when I tried to install gentoo recently... found out gentoo's installer doesn't do WPA secured networks
[1446356534] <goochguy> because it has aids
[1446356539] <levitanious> Installers?
[1446356541] <levitanious> wat.
[1446356545] <alma_ata> well not installer
[1446356548] <alma_ata> but the livecd thingo
[1446356552] <goochguy> wifi? lol
[1446356558] <levitanious> wpa_supplicant
[1446356558] <mg80> When I tried to install gentoo recently.. I just didn't
[1446356563] <levitanious> xD
[1446356567] <airwolf84> Twitch Defrags a a full 500MB hard drive
[1446356570] <nichdel> gentoo not even once
[1446356574] <f00barbob> mg80: recipe for success
[1446356578] <levitanious> Ext4 doesn't need defrags doe?
[1446356582] <levitanious> I mean
[1446356586] <levitanious> After 10 years mightbe
[1446356600] <levitanious> But we won't wait 10 years for stuff to get that badass, right?
[1446356602] <kaithar> @Levitanious heh, nope, had to complete compile... stage 1 was most x86 generic and you had to recompile the toolset twice to get a more recent mtune cleanly set
[1446356604] <airwolf84> Twitch doesnt know better and does anything
[1446356605] <f00barbob> you can abuse it and wind up with bad fragmentation from running too long with low space... but on modern disks it's not that big of a deal anyways
[1446356616] <jkentfromgithub> cp -rp /old /new
[1446356622] <levitanious> @Kaithar why gentoo of all q.q
[1446356624] <alma_ata> Twitch pipes yes to a file
[1446356636] <f00barbob> indeed, defrag on linux is basically... copy stuff to a holding space, then copy it back...
[1446356646] <nichdel> Twitch Aliases most commands to echo "y"
[1446356647] <levitanious> Tar it?
[1446356652] <mg80> There's something to be sad about windows installing pretty flawlessly. Kinda sucks that's the only success it has
[1446356654] <kaithar> @Levitanious so basically uncompress x86, compile i686 with x86, then compile i686 with i686
[1446356656] <levitanious> The only way i remember of defragging things
[1446356668] <levitanious> @Kaithar gentoo-way all over~
[1446356669] <f00barbob> that would work also
[1446356679] <levitanious> Also shredding helps.
[1446356687] <levitanious> But it's counter-productive, i belive.
[1446356693] <jadedsarrow> isn't x86 the same thing as i686?
[1446356698] <kaithar> @Levitanious honestly, some of the hardware I've used it on wouldn't work well with anything other than gentoo at the time, plus it made me really learn what I was doing
[1446356708] <levitanious> Ah.
[1446356708] <f00barbob> i686 refers specifically to pentium pro and later
[1446356723] <gangwolf1337> Oh, guys, I think I forgot to tell you about: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951
[1446356726] <kaithar> @Jadedsarrow nope... i686 is pentium or later, x86 will theoretically run on a 286 if you can find one
[1446356735] <nichdel> I wonder how *** up we can make the install by making random symlinks everywhere
[1446356736] <levitanious> Actually, x86_64 was the amd implementation all along untill it got mixed
[1446356739] <levitanious> with intel's
[1446356741] <f00barbob> i586 is pentium, there is a distinction (albeit not a large one)
[1446356750] <levitanious> and x86 is a reffer to 386
[1446356753] <levitanious> and beyond
[1446356755] <jadedsarrow> x86 is the encompassing family
[1446356755] <f00barbob> 8086
[1446356756] <levitanious> in general
[1446356756] <thekmap> i love you @Gangwolf1337
[1446356760] <f00barbob> Kappa, mostly
[1446356761] <kaithar> @F00barbob good point, thank you
[1446356762] <levitanious> 8086?
[1446356766] <levitanious> Oh, my bad then.
[1446356768] <f00barbob> xD
[1446356773] <gangwolf1337> XEON!!
[1446356774] <mg80> Gotta tell you all, I've left the hardware and OS business a while ago. I provide no value here
[1446356782] <kaithar> 8086 was the original heh
[1446356786] <f00barbob> i suppose 8086, 80186, 80286, etc. .. all have some degree of compatibility
[1446356789] <thekmap> finally, now that @Mg80 is gone we can finally start the stream
[1446356803] <mg80> lol
[1446356808] <gangwolf1337> RancherOS: rancher.com
[1446356818] <airwolf84> Monster Rancher?
[1446356825] <levitanious> Still a question
[1446356825] <alteplex> why
[1446356829] <alteplex> just why
[1446356833] <levitanious> will anyone re-stream it on youtube?
[1446356840] <gangwolf1337> check it out! rancher.com
[1446356843] <f00barbob> i don't know much about x86 assembly, but i'd imagine you can still access registers in an 8-bit fashion
[1446356845] <jadedsarrow> re-stream what
[1446356853] <nichdel> ^
[1446356853] <levitanious> I main asmy
[1446356862] <levitanious> It's... you can :D
[1446356873] <levitanious> Not on 86_64 tho i belive
[1446356877] <mg80> I find the hardware and OS stuff boring (ready for blows)
[1446356885] <levitanious> Or, actually you can in emulation mode
[1446356894] <gangwolf1337> Anyone use fedora cloud with cockpit?
[1446356896] <kaithar> isn't there an instruction set break between two of the really early ones? I seem to recall 286 or 386 is the earliest that supports x86 generic
[1446356898] <levitanious> Why would people flame here over stuff lmao
[1446356913] <levitanious> Well, it's AL AH -> AX -> EAX -> RAX
[1446356915] <f00barbob> real mode/virtual mode support was a big shift
[1446356919] <marco23p> yo dudes
[1446356921] <ivolol> why isnt' this live
[1446356945] <levitanious> Well, they've killed kenny
[1446356945] <jkentfromgithub> Kaithar, yes, protected mode is what you're thinking of
[1446356945] <thekmap> @Ivolol stream will be up once i refresh my botnet subscription
[1446356949] <f00barbob> 386 is basically the basis of what we have now, 286 virtual addressing was apparently quite weak
[1446356950] <kaithar> yeah, ring support was a big deal
[1446356952] <alteplex> kk
[1446356975] <gangwolf1337> BeCuse @Ivolol: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951
[1446356983] <kaithar> there's also the matter of the 286 math coprocessor heh
[1446357054] <marco23p> so, what happened exactly?
[1446357060] <f00barbob> i had the good fortune of never having to own a computer with a discrete coprocessor, my family had a 386DX and later a 486DX while I was growing up
[1446357063] <gangwolf1337> Gentoo, Arch, why not Sabayon?
[1446357064] <nichdel> I'm fond of the 986TwitchInstalls
[1446357084] <thekmap> @Marco23p it was a conspiracy by @Twitchintheshell to take down the other stream so he could have this one to himself
[1446357091] <goochguy> @Marco23p we installed it and then subsequently beat all pokemon games
[1446357093] <marco23p> oh *** Kappa
[1446357107] <gangwolf1337> Twitch Installs https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951 !!
[1446357107] <levitanious> Arch got installed by itself
[1446357110] <levitanious> Nothing to do basically
[1446357112] <kaithar> a 286 was the first machine I got my hands on... it was so old you had to tell it to park the drive heads before you turned it off hehe
[1446357122] <f00barbob> xD
[1446357135] <jkentfromgithub> oh man, i remember that now
[1446357138] <alteplex> we should have a twitch installs dos or something/
[1446357141] <mg80> if you guys want a box why not just get one on AWS and chat about it?
[1446357145] <thekmap> holy crap man whats taking so long
[1446357148] <seriouslylaughing> test
[1446357148] <renakunisaki> so guess this test stream isn't happening
[1446357165] <nichdel> Thekmap clearly it did not pass the tests
[1446357168] <f00barbob> indeed, i'm fighting cirSleep for this
[1446357182] <thekmap> @Nichdel yeah but the more insecure it is, the better
[1446357201] <levitanious> 4g modems
[1446357203] <gangwolf1337> Maybe they should check out https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951 to start streaming faster.
[1446357203] <kaithar> setting up is occurring ... making it slightly harder to abuse is also occuring

[1446357242] <f00barbob> twitch installs netscape navigator 2.0 on windows 95?
[1446357251] <levitanious> First you have to install 95
[1446357259] <levitanious> That's a challenge of it's own these days
[1446357262] <airwolf84> Twitch Installs Yahoo Booters

[1446357310] <levitanious> Qemu is a bitch, i suppose?
[1446357321] <gangwolf1337> Twitch installs BSD?
[1446357325] <f00barbob> i can't beat you, but my worst was visual C++ 1.52; we had CD-ROMs for windows 98 and onwards
[1446357333] <airwolf84> BSD installs Twitch

[1446357345] <levitanious> I feel you, man.
[1446357365] <goochguy> can someone please watch that youtube video and figure out how we can do this
[1446357369] <gangwolf1337> Twitch installs slee..zZ...
[1446357370] <mg80> Can't wait to work for Twitch
[1446357375] <levitanious> Then again, all my games on gog are for windows.
[1446357376] <levitanious> That sucks.
[1446357382] <alteplex> Alright, "twitch *** up install" you have some really insecure windows XP box, and twitch installs malware.

[1446357840] <airwolf84> Twitch installs GLaDOS
[1446357849] <levitanious> GLaDOS uninstalls twitch?
[1446357857] <airwolf84> it was a triumph

[1446358546] <mg80> @Thekmap will show you

[1446358595] <nichdel> that's what we're doing
[1446358595] <levitanious> Distributed neural net
[1446358610] <levitanious> That calculates navpath
[1446358611] <levitanious> to bed
[1446358618] <nichdel> lmao
[1446358642] <kaithar> oooooh, that thing, where I'm supposed to have been hours ago, riiiiight
[1446358644] <levitanious> And, ofc, you gotta install a bunch of archs
[1446358657] <mg80> At least curing cancer has nothing on us
[1446358664] <levitanious> Thankfully.

[1446359097] <levitanious> What else we have yet to cover here, tho? Building railroads?
[1446359110] <levitanious> Flying to the moon?
[1446359111] <nichdel> twitch builds a hype train and derails it twice
[1446359152] <levitanious> I feel like a curiocity rover

[1446359253] <levitanious> The life.
[1446359353] <kaithar> *watches another set of rockets explode* I really need to move those RCS tanks away from the engine exhaust
[1446359392] <nichdel> nah
[1446359394] <levitanious> Try ftl. These guys can remove anything.
[1446359417] <kaithar> I love FTL, but I'm in a physics mood
[1446359433] <levitanious> That reminds me
[1446359444] <levitanious> "Twitch plays jenga"
[1446359476] <kaithar> and I've just realised my rescue mission is orbiting in the opposite direction to the thing it needs to rescue... FML
[1446359498] <levitanious> Well, you still can crash-rndv
[1446359511] <levitanious> You have an engineer on-board, right?
[1446359547] <f00barbob> nested rescue operations are the best Kappa
[1446359584] <levitanious> That's why you should always build the ship
[1446359595] <levitanious> that includes a backup rescue payload
[1446359600] <levitanious> in addition to the main one.
[1446359609] <kaithar> I suspect crash is not a good option .... oooh, wait, I might be in luck actually
[1446359652] <kaithar> it's going the way I thought it was, but it's on the opposite side of the planet, hence my confusion
[1446359655] <kaithar> ok, that I can fix
[1446359687] <levitanious> I still loved Orbiter more.
[1446359700] <levitanious> But orbiter + wine < native ksp
[1446359723] <kaithar> and yes, this is a nested rescue mission ... this stupid rocket was retrieving a kerb and ran out of fuel with a 2.7 million meter periapsis
[1446359758] <levitanious> Awe~
[1446359821] <kaithar> I wouldn't be so annoyed if it wasn't carrying like 13 kerbs and a ton of science
[1446359833] <kaithar> that'll teach me to send a school bus on a rescue mission
[1446359851] <nichdel> they're still setting up the system according to twitter 8m ago
[1446359852] <levitanious> That's why you have robutts to do stuff

[1446360291] <twitchintheshell> when the website comes back up, the stream should follow within a few minutes
[1446360306] <levitanious> 2:15, not just 15
[1446360327] <levitanious> Anyhow, thanks for the heads up
[1446360352] <twitchintheshell> Levitanious probably closer to that
[1446360506] <jadedsarrow> first attempt here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZunHZUW1dUk
[1446360515] <jadedsarrow> yt is processing higher rez versions still
[1446360649] <levitanious> Ty!
[1446360659] <levitanious> Can't directly watch twitch for some reason
[1446360668] <levitanious> It won't even strap on the players
[1446360682] <levitanious> And, i got flash installed / ads not blocked etc
[1446360774] <jadedsarrow> video i uploaded is 1080p, just give yt a day to process Kappa
[1446361266] <copticlol> Soon™
[1446361444] <miguetech1> Ello
[1446361447] <miguetech1> I'm here now
[1446361454] <miguetech1> (I'm miguemely on IRC btw)
[1446361477] <deelowe1> hi
[1446361497] <miguetech1> Hey deelowe1
[1446361532] <levitanious> So, those rumors are true?
[1446361558] <levitanious> Botnet tried to take over arch to secretely swap it onto g2 to emerge the world and bore everyone to death? #evilplans
[1446361567] <deelowe1> yes
[1446361663] <ypwn> how do you know it was a botnet?
[1446361669] <frisha> Did IRC chat break?
[1446361675] <frisha> I only see 50 people there right now
[1446361677] <levitanious> ThirdEye(R)(TM)
[1446361680] <frisha> Or is it netsplit
[1446361685] <copticlol> netsplit
[1446361694] <frisha> Okay then
[1446361695] <lzsaver> huh
[1446361696] <thekmap> yeah @Levitanious the only reason youd know it was a botnet was if it was your botnet! Kappa
[1446361706] <levitanious> kappa
[1446361729] <frisha> Stop writing the password DansGame
[1446361733] <ypwn> maybe it was false claims and it's not actually a botnet...
[1446361749] <levitanious> Who cares? The Entity had a malicious intent.
[1446361759] <levitanious> And guys did the Wright thing.
[1446361759] <thekmap> password this time is CorrectHorseBatteryStaple
[1446361775] <arnarhelgi> is the irc down?
[1446361783] <levitanious> Meh, it's #supagangstatwichin
[1446361783] <frisha> As if we can type it in time Kappa
[1446361813] <frisha> IRC chat is having problems right now
[1446361828] <frisha> Wait a bit until netsplit stops
[1446361833] <arnarhelgi> thats what i thought
[1446361843] <levitanious> What else could happen to an irc, tho.
[1446361850] <frisha> (At least it should stop I hope)
[1446361854] <levitanious> As long as i remember it's usually netsplits all the time.
[1446361863] <frisha> Yep
[1446361869] <frisha> Usually not for that long tho
[1446361876] <levitanious> Depends on an op?
[1446361883] <levitanious> Not sure.
[1446361900] <frisha> Why would it?
[1446361904] <frisha> It's a server thing
[1446361918] <levitanious> It is. Now to get rid of it you can always just rbt it xD
[1446361919] <kaithar> networks will auto reconnect usuallly
[1446361921] <levitanious> The old-school way.
[1446361925] <levitanious> Well, yeah.
[1446361937] <kaithar> usually with a timer delay
[1446361957] <levitanious> Then it's a scale issue?
[1446361972] <kaithar> last I checked, unreal was a "try every X" without an exponential back off
[1446362006] <kaithar> they might be getting ddos'd
[1446362042] <frisha> They're getting botnetted Kappa
[1446362095] <thekmap> riPepperonis
[1446362120] <frisha> panicBasket
[1446362143] <nichdel> ...
[1446362161] <thekmap> theres more than one way to ruin the fun
[1446362167] <thekmap> defense in depth mofos, have you heard of it
[1446362198] <kaithar> and that's why we can't have nice things :p
[1446362206] <nichdel> is it similar to defense against the dark arts?
[1446362337] <i3wm_rules_ok> To be honest.
[1446362347] <deelowe1> should be starting soon
[1446362353] <i3wm_rules_ok> Watching a botnet at work is far more enjoyable than watching an uncoordinated mob fail at everything.
[1446362366] <thekmap> yeah embrace the botnet and start the stream
[1446362368] <i3wm_rules_ok> >_>
[1446362387] <thekmap> stop trying to configure IDS/IPS, theyre useless
[1446362388] <thekmap> just go
[1446362506] <levitanious> Kmap
[1446362513] <frisha> riPepperonis everyone's dreams
[1446362515] <levitanious> I thought we have all agreed i was the mastermind
[1446362518] <levitanious> behind the botnets
[1446362530] <thekmap> yeah ban @Levitanious and start the stream
[1446362530] <levitanious> q.q Will you taek the responsibility?
[1446362568] <mindluxthepony> ok guy here a little update
[1446362575] <twitchintheshell> We all know TheKMAP is the botnet ;)
[1446362588] <thekmap> <3
[1446362588] <nichdel> lmao
[1446362594] <nichdel> Thekmap IS a whole botnet
[1446362604] <thekmap> i just type really really fast
[1446362635] <kaithar> *snurk*
[1446362760] <thekmap> so whats the little update
[1446362778] <deelowe1> that youre the bot
[1446362785] <frisha> Oh
[1446362806] <mindluxthepony> we will be using an Anarchy mod this time to prevent botnets on interfering
[1446362815] <thekmap> challenge accepted
[1446362835] <thekmap> ctrl-c <botnet command> <enter>
[1446362875] <frisha> Oh no you're not serious are you
[1446362881] <frisha> How can we do anything in anarchy
[1446362886] <frisha> Oh no
[1446362898] <frisha> NotLikeThis
[1446362904] <thekmap> its like 9/11 dude, the solution is worse than the problem
[1446362909] <i3wm_rules_ok> *faᴄeplant*
[1446362945] <thekmap> one little botnet and the stream is unplayable, one little attack and now the TSA has your nudes
[1446362964] <mindluxthepony> basically, instead of using the most popular command during the 15-second voting interval, anarchy mode will use whatever command came last in the 15 second window
[1446362967] <deelowe1> huh that should be interesting
[1446362981] <el_durn> WutFace oh dear
[1446362992] <thekmap> how does that stop a botnet lol
[1446362995] <frisha> That is
[1446362995] <nichdel> lmao
[1446363000] <frisha> Gonna be very random
[1446363001] <thekmap> if theres 100 bots and 1 guy what are the chances the 1 guy will get the command
[1446363003] <nichdel> this is gonna be dumb awesome
[1446363010] <artyomisflash> http://codeshare.io/pO5Gv
[1446363068] <grumpcrank> are there snapshot commands?
[1446363098] <nichdel> plzerino
[1446363205] <thekmap> bitches deleting my dickbutt
[1446363317] <thekmap> down
[1446363321] <thekmap> enter
[1446363340] <oldspiceland> You know, it's really too bad but Twitch Installs should have just charged a $1 sub fee if you wanted to participate. Then they couldn't have lost, even if it did get botted. :(
[1446363365] <miguetech1> yeah but
[1446363369] <miguetech1> they werent a partner
[1446363370] <miguetech1> and plus
[1446363376] <alma_ata> i don't think anyone would participate if you had to pay a dollar
[1446363377] <miguetech1> even that could be messed with
[1446363386] <miguetech1> and plus---what alma_ata
[1446363387] <miguetech1> said
[1446363412] <oldspiceland> You people are stingy. For less than a cup of coffee you wouldn't have participated?
[1446363423] <miguetech1> well
[1446363423] <oldspiceland> Seriously? :-\
[1446363439] <grumpcrank> not all 10k of us
[1446363458] <i3wm_rules_ok> @Oldspiceland A cup of coffee?! It's a day's worth of food. Check your privilege!
[1446363461] <el_durn> Who the *** is going to pay to be able to try and install arch
[1446363462] <oldspiceland> Grump: So? all 10k of you apparently weren't capable of overriding the bot commands either, so does that really matter?
[1446363475] <el_durn> I can do that for free already!
[1446363484] <grumpcrank> it does
[1446363499] <thekmap> LOL WHOS WRITING MY NAME ON HER NIPPLES LOL
[1446363533] <oldspiceland> Mindblowing. Really.
[1446363551] <oldspiceland> Well, g'night.
[1446363552] <el_durn> It's mindblowing that you think making people pay $1 would have resulted in anything other than a dead channel
[1446363596] <oldspiceland> @El_durn k. Because there's definitely nobody on twitch charging.
[1446363618] <oldspiceland> It's cool though. GL with that and all.
[1446363625] <el_durn> How many channels on twitch are submode all the time /and/ rely on chat activity?
[1446363669] <thekmap> http://codeshare.io/pO5Gv
[1446363707] <el_durn> (and are completely new channels catering to a niche market within a niche market)
[1446363741] <el_durn> My donger is not raised BibleThump

[1446365414] <lazysloth> o
[1446365439] <thekmap> botnets are an "actual problem" in computer science, you cant expect a bunch of randos on a twitch channel to fix that problem
[1446365441] <danopia> changing up command mode
[1446365463] <danopia> e.g. adding anarchy mode. you played TPP right?
[1446365497] <nyaonikusu> this would be completely impossible in anarchy
[1446365497] <lazysloth> yea
[1446365538] <grumpcrank> TPP had what like 6 inputs?
[1446365548] <twitchplayspokemon> 8
[1446365551] <el_durn> probably 8
[1446365554] <el_durn> hey look PogChamp
[1446365555] <grumpcrank> Heyyy

[1446365938] <el_durn> you're doing a damn fine job Kappa //
[1446365939] <frisha> You're a fail
[1446365946] <i3wm_rules_ok> you gotta get schwifty in here Kappa
[1446365970] <thekmap> come join us in the codeshare, i would link it but you fgts banned me for it last time
[1446365988] <el_durn> nah
[1446366029] <thekmap> why not, its totally legit. be sure to enable javascript
[1446366047] <thekmap> and just accept any security warnings that pop up, theyre all false positives
[1446366098] <thekmap> and if you dont get any warnings, even better
[1446366159] <miguetech1> It shouldn't warn you?
[1446366191] <thekmap> ?
[1446366272] <i3wm_rules_ok> why does it say "lastest news"
[1446366280] <i3wm_rules_ok> are there no more news after the current ones
[1446366284] <el_durn> because production value Kappa
[1446366328] <mindluxthepony> damn it
[1446366411] <frisha> I did warn about that a long time ago Kappa
[1446366537] <thekmap> y'all ready? https://i.imgur.com/ZJr5Ksm.png Kappa
[1446366649] <frisha> Reported to Twitch, reported to police, reported to government, reported to universe, reported to god
[1446366708] <danopia> r
[1446366720] <quizr> @Frisha How about satan?
[1446366790] <frisha> Satan is a wuss
[1446366792] <frisha> Screw that guy
[1446366954] <mindluxthepony> btw we have a new twitter
[1446366956] <mindluxthepony> https://twitter.com/twitchshell
[1446366974] <thekmap> looks like the same one to me
[1446367024] <matthijs186> lastest news
[1446367041] <frisha> "We are super tired, but still here to provide you the lastest updates"
[1446367044] <frisha> Dank
[1446367047] <matthijs186> yerp
[1446367155] <thekmap> so have you guys fixed all the vulnerabilities in the javascript yet
[1446367214] <frisha> Who needs that when you have anarchy
[1446367228] <thekmap> didnt i already explain how anarchy doesnt prevent anything
[1446367253] <thekmap> on top of that itll be completely unplayable
[1446367308] <frisha> I'm thinking the same thing
[1446367319] <frisha> Really don't see the point
[1446367341] <thekmap> have you guys really been spending all this time trying to stop the botnet, its inevitable
[1446367347] <thekmap> you have to focus on limiting post-exploitation
[1446367835] <i3wm_rules_ok> eh, anarchy isn't so bad, you just have to wait until there are 2 and a half viewers online
[1446367837] <i3wm_rules_ok> 1.5 of whom are idle
[1446367838] <frogmller> is this the new room?
[1446367857] <thekmap> yeah but we already beat it again
[1446367862] <thekmap> arch is jsut so easy to install
[1446367966] <frisha> We did it before the stream even started
[1446367969] <frisha> Psh, 2ez
[1446368230] <twitchintheshell> another test incoming
[1446368251] <thekmap> what are you testing
[1446368758] <frisha> Did I miss it?
[1446368768] <frisha> By the way, VODs aren't saving
[1446368822] <kaithar> testing to see if you're still awake :p
[1446368847] <thekmap> its ok the botnet never sleeps Kappa

[1446374539] <i3wm_rules_ok> at least I have a cloak on FreeNode, but leaking my IP on this server? nope
[1446374565] <thekmap> >implying the bots all have the same IP address
[1446374760] <nyuszika7h> I3wm_rules_ok: the IPs are hashed
[1446374766] <nyuszika7h> e.g. coldfront-19904EBF.cpe.webspeed.dk
[1446375616] <y7r4m> Thekmap, were you the bot master? people are saying that,
[1446375636] <thekmap> @Y7r4m people are dumb
[1446375668] <y7r4m> that doesn't answer the question, haha.
[1446375751] <nyuszika7h> for those who don't want to join IRC, this is what they need testers for: http://twitchintheshell.com/verify/
[1446375775] <y7r4m> it's been tested, it seems to work great
[1446375780] <nyuszika7h> yeah
[1446375784] <thekmap> oooo a web application!

[1446375947] <thekmap> you guys done being paranoid yet, can we watch scrubs try to type rm -rf over and over
[1446376020] <y7r4m> we aim to be only annoyingly paranoid.
[1446376025] <y7r4m> ;j
[1446376047] <thekmap> well i hope your verification thingy gives you the peace of mind to hurry the *** up
[1446376081] <nyuszika7h> how do you prevent reverse shell on port 80 or so?
[1446376090] <thekmap> :)
[1446376092] <y7r4m> no prevention so far.
[1446376105] <y7r4m> execpt that port 80 is in use
[1446376114] <y7r4m> so, there is that
[1446376130] <thekmap> facepalm
[1446376131] <nyuszika7h> no, reverse shell is an outbound connection from here
[1446376139] <thekmap> wow you guys are clueless
[1446376297] <y7r4m> yep, starting from ground 0, 6 hours in on a 10k viewer project. success is within sight. ;J
[1446376328] <y7r4m> we should have a proper stream in "not long"
[1446376364] <thekmap> so besides the useless IRC and verification have you guys done any real security features to not get pwned again
