[1446352611] <p0larity> I'm starting to get an ocular migraine so I guess that's my cue to actually go to sleep. Not being able to see things puts a damper on enjoying a good train-wreck, anyhow.
[1446352648] <nichdel> My favorite personal alias is yogurt, which checks the arch news feed is w3m and then runs yaourt -Syyua
[1446352658] <slycedix> See ya around P0larity
[1446352663] <nichdel> bye bye P0larity
