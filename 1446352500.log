[1446352611] <p0larity> I'm starting to get an ocular migraine so I guess that's my cue to actually go to sleep. Not being able to see things puts a damper on enjoying a good train-wreck, anyhow.
[1446352648] <nichdel> My favorite personal alias is yogurt, which checks the arch news feed is w3m and then runs yaourt -Syyua
[1446352658] <slycedix> See ya around P0larity
[1446352663] <nichdel> bye bye P0larity
[1446352674] <thekmap> @P0larity auras?
[1446352678] <p0larity> Yeah...
[1446352685] <p0larity> I'll check the news tomorrow. :)
[1446352686] <thekmap> @P0larity induce vomiting and gtfo
[1446352741] <nichdel> Also a tiling manager might be prudent as well
[1446352748] <nichdel> if we get that far
[1446352775] <f00barbob> scrotwm
[1446352786] <slycedix> We should just use X and only X
[1446352797] <f00barbob> i think the name changed, but... scrotwm
[1446352801] <nichdel> nah man, run something in wayland
[1446352829] <f00barbob> just run stuff out of an xterm or something...
[1446352831] <slycedix> HA "run" "wayland"
[1446352848] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell when is the stream starting
[1446352868] <slycedix> Should be around 1 EST
[1446353021] <f00barbob> 0100?
[1446353021] <nichdel> Thekmap I believe I have doxxed you
[1446353026] <nichdel> Are you the hacker 4chan?
[1446353031] <thekmap> @Nichdel cool can you bring me limes
[1446353067] <nichdel> step 1) pretend you *hate* limes
[1446353072] <nichdel> step 2) purposely get doxxed
[1446353074] <f00barbob> would you accept lemons? or are you partial to limes...
[1446353093] <thekmap> @F00barbob needs to be limes
[1446353098] <f00barbob> k

[1446353198] <aterfax> The hacker known as 4CHAN
[1446353213] <slycedix> Who is this 4chan
[1446353237] <thekmap> not me Kappa
[1446353248] <frisha> I think he a hacker
[1446353251] <frisha> *he's
[1446353257] <aterfax> Slycedix I did have a confirmed image
[1446353260] <aterfax> allow me to find it
[1446353282] <aterfax> http://i.imgur.com/qjtBRrk.gif
[1446353292] <thekmap> i'm invincible!
[1446353316] <aterfax> Didn't 007 say
[1446353319] <aterfax> "Cool off"
[1446353324] <deelowe1> should be starting soon
[1446353325] <slycedix> http://i.imgur.com/f7rJAZ7.gif Actually
[1446353332] <slycedix> This is 4chan
[1446353378] <aterfax> tha gif is excellent for more than the obvious
[1446353382] <nichdel> can confirm, I met him on the darknet once
[1446353387] <deelowe1> https://twitter.com/twitchshell
[1446353391] <aterfax> the *** store person is following him around
[1446353437] <slycedix> I love that gif so much
[1446353505] <mindluxthepony> i made that it looks so good
[1446353524] <thekmap> @Slycedix damn you caught me
[1446353530] <twitchintheshell> Still here guys, when the stream returns it will be a test stream followed by the launch again
[1446353539] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell still waitin on my mod
[1446353547] <mindluxthepony> awsome
[1446353551] <nyaonikusu> so i assume it will be here only?
[1446353654] <slycedix> We all are KMAP
[1446353656] <slycedix> We all are
[1446353661] <nyaonikusu> did you think of having it get its internet through a seperate computer
[1446353665] <el_durn> BabyRage never mod BabyRage
[1446353674] <nyaonikusu> then having that computer run through a tor network
[1446353683] <nichdel> Relevant: started pandora nad first song is Swordfish by Dead Milkman
[1446353689] <thekmap> @Nyaonikusu yes, do that. its 100% secure, no way to bypass that Kappa
[1446353692] <nichdel> thus I believe Kmap is indeed 4chan
[1446353697] <nyaonikusu> didnt say it was 100%
[1446353699] <aterfax> honestly
[1446353702] <slycedix> You are joking right Nyaonikusu
[1446353704] <aterfax> thats just shifting the problem
[1446353710] <aterfax> instead of shitting in your own yard
[1446353717] <aterfax> you shat in next doors
[1446353722] <aterfax> kinda douchey
[1446353723] <thekmap> @Aterfax you need to change back to orange man, i miss you was orange
[1446353725] <f00barbob> removing the need for internet connectivity to the instance is probably the most effective way of preventing.... happenings
[1446353739] <slycedix> He is orange for me KMAP
[1446353745] <slycedix> Refresh
[1446353749] <aterfax> better?
[1446353749] <nichdel> kinda peach orange for me
[1446353752] <thekmap> @Aterfax ty
[1446353753] <aterfax> nope that did not work
[1446353757] <aterfax> ok maybe it did
[1446353760] <thekmap> its orange now for me
[1446353770] <nichdel> there you go

[1446353810] <thekmap> @Aterfax so funny lol, i got people sending me resumes and ***
[1446353822] <slycedix> We don't need that link every 3 minutes
[1446353832] <thekmap> @Aterfax got the mofo's address on it and everything
[1446353835] <aterfax> Do they not realise, you haven't even proved yer affiliation yet>
[1446353836] <deelowe1> should be testing soon
[1446353837] <gangwolf1337> ok @Slycedix
[1446353845] <aterfax> I mean, people are literally doxing themselves
[1446353855] <gangwolf1337> but just in case, let me know
[1446353864] <thekmap> so, anyone want a job? i'm hiring :)
[1446353874] <slycedix> If someone asks what happened, link the post
[1446353875] <aterfax> Especially because you get a bonus
[1446353881] <nichdel> Can you pay me to be snarky?
[1446353883] <gangwolf1337> @Thekmap can i send u a link?
[1446353886] <slycedix> otherwise it is just us here and we already know
[1446353893] <aterfax> Is that link TBLOP?
[1446353894] <thekmap> @Gangwolf1337 you are my favorite t roll
[1446353914] <gangwolf1337> Keepo
[1446353919] <thekmap> who needs tblop when you can just go to eporner and get 1080p 60fps porn
[1446353938] <slycedix> Or /r/4kpornvids
[1446353944] <thekmap> make sure youre using an out of date flash player :)
[1446353953] <slycedix> Always
[1446353962] <gangwolf1337> Linux flash: v11
[1446353969] <aterfax> gone are the days of empornium
[1446353975] <aterfax> that place was *** hilarious
[1446353982] <aterfax> they had 4k before youtube had 1080p
[1446354001] <nichdel> a lot of places had 1080 and 4k before youtube
[1446354016] <slycedix> Youtube was way late to the party
[1446354022] <nichdel> until they grew to any size whatsoever and found out why youtube didn't have 1080 yet
[1446354023] <aterfax> that is true
[1446354076] <renakunisaki> too bad Youtube is balls
[1446354101] <slycedix> ^
[1446354110] <aterfax> where 1080p means 720p
[1446354125] <aterfax> eat *** bitrate google says
[1446354128] <slycedix> and where 480p means 4 pixels
[1446354147] <thekmap> yo when did /r/gonewildcurvy become /r/fatchicks
[1446354155] <renakunisaki> when it was created
[1446354156] <nichdel> preach
[1446354162] <aterfax> last 2 or 3 years
[1446354167] <goochguy> day 1
[1446354179] <renakunisaki> and it doesn't matter what resolution because the video will just get deleted for some BS reason anyway
[1446354182] <aterfax> Feminists for ya
[1446354187] <aterfax> Don't body shame
[1446354188] <renakunisaki> or just plain won't work
[1446354189] <goochguy> anything over 80lb is a fat chick
[1446354196] <aterfax> so now any fat *** sow is "sexy"
[1446354206] <renakunisaki> we are talking about chickens right? FrankerZ
[1446354223] <goochguy> equally bangable
[1446354228] <slycedix> "You are not allowed to tell me I am unhealthy because I think i look atractive"
[1446354242] <aterfax> it is an interesting dichotomy
[1446354248] <aterfax> because what they're actually saying is
[1446354265] <aterfax> my opinion is ok and right, but you can't have an opinion and yours is wrong
[1446354283] <aterfax> I love seeing that doublethink
[1446354287] <goochguy> just get the harpoons boys we'll be okay.
[1446354309] <aterfax> >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhVRissCjDo
[1446354320] <aterfax> WHITE WHALE HOLY GRAIL
[1446354331] <gangwolf1337> Oh no @Aterfax https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10484951
[1446354349] <slycedix> God damnit gang
[1446354360] <aterfax> Gangwolf1337 is there something new in there?
[1446354378] <gangwolf1337> @Slycedix I can't help it, and @Aterfax yup
[1446354378] <nichdel> I don't see anything new in the hn feed Gangwolf1337
[1446354386] <levitanious> Nyawh~
[1446354399] <gangwolf1337> @Nichdel then add somthing
[1446354433] <gangwolf1337> @Nichdel need a link? KevinTurtle
[1446354438] <nichdel> wut
[1446354455] <aterfax> http://i.imgur.com/QDLag15.jpg
[1446354501] <levitanious> Oh, btw, what editor people agreed on using? :D
[1446354509] <slycedix> I expected that to be one of those nice guys finish last comics
[1446354510] <levitanious> Was it vi for lulz sake?
[1446354511] <slycedix> I was wrong
[1446354521] <nichdel> 1 true vi
[1446354529] <alteplex> probably nano?
[1446354533] <gangwolf1337> vim
[1446354535] <levitanious> Nano +1 tho
[1446354536] <aterfax> vim because *** more characters up in this ***
[1446354547] <slycedix> vim
[1446354553] <nichdel> Sadly I don't think vim is installed by default so for sanity probs nano
[1446354555] <gangwolf1337> emacs, Kappa
[1446354556] <levitanious> q.q i'm in minority it sims.
[1446354561] <levitanious> seams! (sowwy)
[1446354562] <renakunisaki> rip irc
[1446354566] <aterfax> Guys for the low of *** god
[1446354566] <thekmap> my favorite editor is netcat -e /bin/bash kmap.com 1337
[1446354569] <alteplex> vi is installed by default
[1446354571] <aterfax> use the AUI
[1446354574] <aterfax> scripts
[1446354576] <nichdel> vi /= vim tho
[1446354577] <slycedix> Vim and Nano are both on arch iirc
[1446354580] <alteplex> I knoe
[1446354586] <aterfax> https://github.com/helmuthdu/aui
[1446354588] <aterfax> ^
[1446354593] <aterfax> Save everyone the *** effort
[1446354599] <levitanious> Lol?
[1446354601] <nichdel> let's just use cat and echo instead of editors
[1446354610] <aterfax> Nichdel too easy
[1446354616] <aterfax> I expect sed and awk only
[1446354624] <levitanious> touch it, cat it, vi it, shred it.
[1446354667] <levitanious> Who needs that everything.
[1446354673] <aterfax> Thekmap how many times should I overwrite a pen drive before it's "erased"
[1446354675] <levitanious> Let's just /dev/random everything.
[1446354681] <aterfax> I'm slapping it 7 times
[1446354682] <levitanious> We'll be stuck for months xD
[1446354687] <alteplex> Pen drives are flash memory
[1446354688] <renakunisaki> just one time, with 10000 volts.
[1446354688] <aterfax> but I'm tempted to just drill it
[1446354692] <alteplex> only once
[1446354704] <aterfax> Alteplex correct in theory
[1446354706] <thekmap> @Aterfax destroy it
[1446354711] <aterfax> That doesnt apply to SSDs though
[1446354712] <levitanious> Destroy it.
[1446354719] <aterfax> Cast it into the FIRES
[1446354720] <nichdel> alias a command to pull one char's length of input from /dev/random
[1446354722] <aterfax> DESTROY IT
[1446354723] <levitanious> SSD's has the "safe erase" in firmware but
[1446354727] <nichdel> feed it randomly into ***
[1446354728] <levitanious> It's... i dunno.
[1446354734] <aterfax> Levitanious its not safe
[1446354738] <levitanious> ikr
[1446354741] <kylerb888> What's up with the new channel?
[1446354742] <aterfax> the way SSDs have block breakage
[1446354752] <aterfax> you can get entire preserved blocks Read only
[1446354756] <aterfax> cannot erase
[1446354759] <f00barbob> 1400C recommended for complete data removal
[1446354765] <alteplex> Even with HDD's only one wipe is really needed.
[1446354768] <aterfax> F00barbob not for HDDs
[1446354773] <aterfax> curie point is like
[1446354776] <aterfax> 500?
[1446354776] <f00barbob> indeed, oven tempeature :3
[1446354778] <f00barbob> ye
[1446354784] <nichdel> Aterfax just fill it with porn repeatedly
[1446354808] <goochguy> or 0's. 0's are cool too.
[1446354817] <renakunisaki> 500C is 932F, whose oven goes that high
[1446354821] <alteplex> dd /dev/zero
[1446354830] <aterfax> Nichdel what do you think I am trying to get rid of Kreygasm
[1446354848] <goochguy> CP
[1446354855] <aterfax> god no
[1446354857] <slycedix> Rena, I hear the Ovens in WWII got pretty hot
[1446354858] <goochguy> lmao
[1446354858] <f00barbob> my oven, prob'ly
[1446354872] <renakunisaki> well sure but not many of us have access to those
[1446354887] <aterfax> I cannot have anyone find my administrative nurses quadruple stump porn.
[1446354895] <alteplex> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX iflag=nocache oflag=direct bs=4096
[1446354921] <levitanious> time for some perl -e action i see? :D
[1446354941] <jadedsarrow> wont 4k block sizes be kinda slow with those flags?
[1446354952] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell hurry up man
[1446354956] <f00barbob> just do bs=65536 and let the rest be sorted out byt the system
[1446355020] <levitanious> Oh, meanwhile. What's gonna be ontop of X?
[1446355021] <nichdel> bs=2
[1446355022] <levitanious> a WM?
[1446355023] <levitanious> DE?
[1446355034] <alteplex> i3
[1446355040] <alteplex> have to go tiling
[1446355044] <nichdel> i3 is a good choice
[1446355047] <thekmap> were gonna install vmware, and then install a windows box on top of that, and im going to backdoor the windows box
[1446355057] <levitanious> o_o
[1446355063] <nichdel> I'd pref bspwm if we want the challenge of writing the configs first
[1446355064] <levitanious> exploitabl
[1446355070] <levitanious> fluxbox here~
[1446355077] <levitanious> Dunno how many of you do prefer it.
[1446355077] <thekmap> and then im going to escape the windows box, root the arch, then escape qemu and wite the host machine
[1446355089] <goochguy> 10/10
[1446355099] <levitanious> Not deep enough
[1446355105] <thekmap> then i will change the streamer's cell phone background to dickbutt
[1446355111] <levitanious> Ah.
[1446355112] <goochguy> "twitch watches thekmap hack things"
[1446355115] <aterfax> 10/10 would reverse tunnel again
[1446355147] <levitanious> Amazingly fast the replacement was found tho.
[1446355148] <nichdel> hacker horror story: root the windows machine to find it's in a vm, root the vm to find it's on bsd, root bsd to end up back in the windows machine
[1446355149] <jkentfromgithub> via adb?
[1446355150] <nichdel> forever
[1446355171] <aterfax> >twitch installs arch and finds were actually in a pocket universe
[1446355177] <levitanious> Windows machine on vps
[1446355183] <levitanious> *
[1446355186] <airwolf84> twitch uninstalls twitch
[1446355188] <twitchintheshell> Test stream incoming
[1446355192] <levitanious> Yay!
[1446355194] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell mod me!
[1446355197] <goochguy> yay
[1446355198] <alteplex> We should put some kind of cryptocurrency miner on it
[1446355201] <slycedix> Me too
[1446355207] <nichdel> Twitchintheshell mod me!
[1446355209] <renakunisaki> it's Amigas all the way down.
[1446355210] <twitchintheshell> Alteplex I support this idea.
[1446355229] <nichdel> instead of installing everything can we just get x up and ssh -x into a working machine?
[1446355243] <goochguy> hows that fun
[1446355250] <thekmap> @Nichdel yes make the box internet-accessible Kappa
[1446355255] <defying> yay Keepo
[1446355268] <levitanious> Wonders of the web~
[1446355270] <thekmap> can someone tell me when the stream is actually up, i have flash disabled
[1446355281] <justin97530> What happened to twitchinstalls?
[1446355285] <levitanious> It died.
[1446355287] <goochguy> nobody tell him, it'll be funny.
[1446355287] <jadedsarrow> nobody tell him when it's up

[1446355310] <aterfax> of 5 hours ago
[1446355315] <nichdel> ^
[1446355317] <nichdel> baaaad memories
[1446355322] <alteplex> those were dark times
[1446355327] <justin97530> do the organisers know who did it?
[1446355330] <airwolf84> bad RAM?
[1446355333] <alteplex> full of kappa passwords
[1446355333] <levitanious> When Aranna was young, but not innocent?
[1446355338] <goochguy> bad memories of repeating "no there was a botnet" every 5 seconds when someone new joins lol
[1446355348] <nichdel> we're pretty sure it was Thekmap aka 4chan aka modhim2015
[1446355350] <y7r4m> Hows it going?
[1446355371] <goochguy> i agree all signs point to thekmap
[1446355377] <thekmap> :(
[1446355382] <levitanious> The ScapeGoat.
[1446355384] <alteplex> I got it, we should download a car, and copy that floppy!
[1446355387] <levitanious> Change your nick.
[1446355407] <nichdel> Twitch Gets a Cease and Desist for Pirating on a Public Stream
[1446355415] <levitanious> xD

[1446356191] <mg80> my new friends....
[1446356195] <alma_ata> it would be funny how far we can take it lol
[1446356198] <airwolf84> twitch saves 15% on car insurance by switching to Geico
[1446356199] <nichdel> so eventually it's just a working arch install that people use for running emulators and stuff
[1446356219] <levitanious> What do you use arch for tho?
[1446356221] <alteplex> No, its a gentoo install
[1446356226] <irisiridal> you're never done installing arch
[1446356228] <levitanious> Gentoo is a tool.

[1446356245] <thekmap> @Twitchintheshell with the next-level strats of waiting until no one cares anymore before launching the stream
[1446356247] <nichdel> twitch successfull maintains a working arch install

[1446356287] <mg80> I'm only here because I thought it would be entertaining when reading about it
[1446356288] <alteplex> some people just want to watch the world burn.
[1446356288] <levitanious> No. Not that, please.
